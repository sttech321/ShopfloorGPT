# ShopfloorGPT
Agent-based chat demo built with NestJS, TypeScript, and LangGraph/LangChain. It exposes a simple /api/chat endpoint and browser UI that route messages through a hierarchical “ShopfloorGPT” workflow (router + specialist agents for safety, maintenance, and planning). The LLM backend is pluggable: use Anthropic Claude (e.g., Sonnet 4.5)
